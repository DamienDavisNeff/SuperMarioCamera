# SuperMarioCamera

In the Super Mario games, the camera follows the player along the x axis when you move forward, but not when you go backwards!

This script brings that camera movement to unity.

To Use: 

1) Add This Script To The Camera.
2) Make Sure Your Player Is Tagged As Such
3) The Rest Will Be Done For You!

And, I'm pretty sure you are done. If you have any issues, contact `contact@thirdplacestudios.ga`
