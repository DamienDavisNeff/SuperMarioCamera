# SuperMarioCamera

In the Super Mario games, the camera follows the player along the x axis when you move forward, but not when you go backwards!

This script brings that camera movement to unity.

To Use: 

1) Add Script To Main Camera
2) Make Sure The Player Is Tagged As "Player"
3) The Rest Will Be Done For You!

And, I'm pretty sure you are done. If you have any issues, contact `contact@thirdplacestudios.ga`
